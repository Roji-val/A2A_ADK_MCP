## Introduction

In the era of advanced technology, multi-agent systems (MAS) play a crucial role in developing intelligent applications. This repository combines the power of Google's **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** with the **A2A** framework and **MCP** to create a robust environment for building MAS. 

### What is A2A?

A2A (Agent-to-Agent) is a communication protocol that enables agents to interact with each other seamlessly. This facilitates complex task management and improves system efficiency.

### What is MCP?

MCP (Multi-Agent Control Protocol) provides the necessary control mechanisms for managing interactions among agents. It ensures that agents can coordinate their actions effectively.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Integrate various agents with minimal effort.
- **Scalability**: Build systems that can grow with your needs.
- **Real-time Communication**: Enable agents to communicate in real-time.
- **Customizable Agents**: Create agents tailored to your specific requirements.
- **Robust Documentation**: Comprehensive guides to help you get started.

## Installation

To get started with the A2A_ADK_MCP project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Roji-val/A2A_ADK_MCP.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd A2A_ADK_MCP
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Roji-val/A2A_ADK_MCP/releases) to download the latest version. Execute the downloaded file to set up the application.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start building your multi-agent systems. Here‚Äôs a basic example to get you started:

1. **Create a New Agent**:
   ```python
   from agent import Agent

   class MyAgent(Agent):
       def __init__(self, name):
           super().__init__(name)

       def perform_task(self):
           print(f"{self.name} is performing a task.")
   ```

2. **Initialize and Run the Agent**:
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       agent = MyAgent("Agent007")
       agent.perform_task()
   ```

This simple code snippet shows how to create and run an agent. Expand upon this by integrating more agents and utilizing the A2A and MCP features.
